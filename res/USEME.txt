- USING THE GUI

- Loading and image ----------------------------------------
- Upon running the main method, the user is prompted with a frame that indicates the user to load
- in an image file.

- In the menu at the very top of the frame, there's 4 items: File, Select, Layers, and Transformations.

- To load in an image, the user can go to the File item, and select load. A JFileChooser should pop up
- and allow the user to choose the file they want and open it.

- Applying image transformations ----------------------------------------
- Once the image is loaded in, the user can choose to apply and image transformation. In the menu item
- Transformations, the user can choose to apply blur, grayscale, sharpen, or sepia transformation on the image.

- Selecting layers ----------------------------------------
- If the user goes to the Select menu item, the number should say 1, indicating that there is one image layer
- loaded. The number should stay at 1 even when the up or down buttons are pressed, since there is only
- one image layer. After creating new layers, you can select which layer to apply image transformations, which
- layer to delete, and set the visibility of that layer.

- Creating new layers ----------------------------------------
- To create a new layer, the user can go to the Layers menu item and click create. This would create a second
- layer.

- After creating a layer, the user must load in an image into that layer. Simply, go to the Select menu item,
- click the up button to indicate that you want to select the second layer. Then, go to the File menu item
- to load in an image, and load in the second layer image. The image must be of the same dimensions
- as the first image. Apply transformations wanted.

- Creating layers ----------------------------------------
- To delete a layer, go to the Select menu item to select which layer you want to delete. Then, go to the
- Layers menu item and click delete. The layer is now deleted.

- Setting visibility of layers ----------------------------------------
- To set the visibility of a layer, go to the Select menu item to select which layer you want to set
- the visibility of. Then, go to the Layers menu item and hover over Visible. Here, you can set the
- visibility of the layer selected to true or false.

- Saving an image ----------------------------------------
- To save an image, go to the File menu item and click save. A JFileChooser will open up and save the image
- as the same format the original loaded image was, and it will be saved wherever you want it to be saved from
- the JFileChooser. This will save the topmost layer image.

- Saving all images ----------------------------------------
- To save all image layers, go to the File menu item and click save all. A JFileChooser will open up and save all
- image layers as the same format the original loaded image was, and it will be saved wherever you want it to be saved from
- the JFileChooser. A text file will also be saved to indicate the filepath of all images saved.
